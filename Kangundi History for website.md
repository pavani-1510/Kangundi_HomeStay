**Introduction**

Early South Indian villages are understood as foundational social units from which later urban forms emerged. As J. W. Hewitt observes, “the primitive village must have been the parent of the earliest form of the later city, which is invariably built round a centre, the site of the original market place and temple”.[^1] This structural observation is directly relevant to villages such as Kangundi, where temples, markets, and agrarian spaces formed the nucleus of settlement life. The origins of these villages are traced to forest-dwelling communities who gradually transitioned to settled agriculture.

**Geographical setting of Kangundi** 

The historic village of Kangundi located in Chittoor district of Andhra Pradesh , was constitutive of Baramahal during the late medieval period and witnessed the successive layers of economic stages ranging from Tribal formations to feudal mode of production and then shared tastes and dispositions thus making it as cultural and social habitus. The then Zamindari is located in the eastern part of Kuppam and south-west corner of Krishnagiri district, lying between 12\*35’ and 12\*56  N and 78\*14’ and 78\*35 E, with an area of 347 sq.miles. it is located in the south west of Chittoor at a distance of 54 miles. 

**Early Development and Historical Foundations** 

**Prehistory**

No Paleolithic or Neolithic tools have been found in the plains of the region, though later Stone Age implements are abundant and display finer workmanship than those of the Deccan; Neolithic tools occur mainly in the hill ranges of the Shevaroys, Kalrayans, Kolli-malais, Vattala-malais, Melagiris, and the Guttirayan. Cairns and Pandava “pits” or “shrines,” locally known as *Pandavagullu*, are widely distributed along the Morappur–Harur road, near Kundani, Gummalapuram, Bapalanattam near Palamaneru, and in villages around Kuppam, where Kuruba communities venerate them as ancestral monuments. 

Archaeological explorations at the Bargur factory by Bruce Foote and surveys in the Upper Palar basin by H. N. Singh, K. Rajan, V. Ramireddy, and P. C. Venkata Subbaiah reveal a dense concentration of prehistoric sites dominated by megalithic burials associated with iron-using cultures that reached South India around 700 BCE. The scale and organization of these monuments indicate advanced social and political systems, generally linked with Dravidian-speaking communities that were culturally dominant in the later first millennium BCE. In Chittoor district, megaliths remain embedded in village life, seen in cairns near Mallakunta, the dolmen known as *Pandavula Banda* at Marrimakulapalle, painted rock shelters near Venkateswara Kotalam and Biradanapalle, dolmen-shrines in villages such as Utugollapalle, Rajupeta, and Giddaepalle, and even reused structures like the cattle-shelter dolmen at Chimagollapalle, demonstrating the continuity of prehistoric heritage in living traditions.

Villages like Mulabanda** and Kurumbapalle reflect the strong connection between these monuments and tribal and pastoral communities, who believe them to be linked to their ancestors. Together, these places show how the megaliths of Kuppam region continue to shape stories, beliefs, and daily life, keeping the ancient past alive in the present.

The tribal formations in Kangundi are evident with the presence of indigenous tribes of Irula and Yanadi and the pre historic rock paintings in the Kangundi Hill. The pre-historic rock painting in the Knagundi hill stands as a living example for the antiquity of the region. The region of Kuppam in Chittoor District along with Hosur in Tamilnadu is a trilingual and tricultural Dravidian land. Once popular as Kangundi Kuppam named after the first habitation Kangundi by the local zamindars. 

**Rise of Little Chieftancy**

` `Kangundi Kuppam, a pre-capitalist samsthanam, or principality, thrived for centuries, embodying a deep bond between the ruler and the ruled. This ancient estate in South India, as genealogical records reveal, was governed by approximately twenty-seven generations. It also acted as a vital link between the colony and the metropolis, facilitating the shift toward modernity in the 19th and 20th centuries. Over the course of nearly nine centuries, the Kangundi Zamindari was under the control of roughly twenty-six rulers, each pledging loyalty to the political forces that periodically dominated the entire South. The recorded history of the Kangundi-Kuppam area kicks off in 1066 AD. It all started with Kambinaidu, a direct descendant of Mallinaidu, who hailed from the Pyapili chiefdom in Kurnool district. Kambinaidu, the third son of Mallinaidu, a minor chieftain in Pyapili, left his home and made his way to Maharajgarh, a place still largely untouched. He established a settlement there, which he named ‘Anganamala’, on the higher ground. At the base of this upland, he constructed a fortified settlement called ‘Gonuguru’.[^2] 

A space for religious articulation was created by constructing a temple for *Veta/ Betarayaswamy*, Legitimisation   of chief dom was made by representing their hunting activity in the form of the deity being engaged in hunting. This temple was a microcosm of the primeval wilderness with the deity being seated engaged in hunting. He, then extended his friendship to Kangadu, the Irula Tribal leader and his wife Kangi who controlled the present kangundi village. Through them,  Kambi Naidu came to know the secret routes from the kangundi Hill. The strategic location of Kangundi attracted  his attention for strengthening of his power in the region.According to official records, after defeating the tribal couple, the Zamindars made it mandatory to perform puja to their burials on Mallappa Konda (the Kangundi hill), demonstrating a complex relationship between conquest and spiritual acknowledgment. He fortified the hill and constructed a palace at its base, while building temples dedicated to Malleswara and Basaveswara on the hilltop, creating both military and religious infrastructure. His territorial expansion extended across multiple regions including Tummisi, Diguvapalem, Chinna Kangundi, Betamangala, Tayalur, Budikota, Melpatti, and Javadipalem through defeating respective feudal lords, establishing a feudal chiefdom that would evolve into one of South India's most enduring zamindari systems. The name 'Kangundi Durgam' was a tribute to the vanquished tribal leader Kangadu, and it also served to legitimize Kambinaidu's rule, bolstered by both religious and military projects.

The culmination of Kangundi's development occurred during Raja Chinnaveerappa Naidu's reign (1185-1231 AD). He commissioned the impressive Kangundi Krishnaswami and Virupaksheswara temples, funded by grants from the villages of Kennavasanapalli and Sivakuruburu, which were designated to keep the lamps burning. Chinnaveerappa Naidu, in 1241 AD, also made his mark on agriculture, implementing tank irrigation systems. He constructed the substantial "Tata Veerappanayudu's Cheruvu" reservoir and, through land grants, established Brahmin settlements as Agraharas in the villages of Masikem and Gandlapalli.During 1299-1361 A.D. Raja Vankatapathi Naidu constructed the village ‘Kakimadugu’ as agraharams for Brahmins.  The village of Bangarunatham was constructed for them and an irrigated tank was constructed in the village. This tank is still known as the source of irrigating the lands and for fisher men communities. The Veerabhadreswara Temple was constructed at Busi Naidupalyam and was donated to Saiva Brahmins.Kangundi Krishnaswami Temple and Virupaksheswara Temple were built by Momurddi Chinnaveerappa Naidu during 1185 A.D. – 1231 A.D. [^3] The villages of Kennavasana palli and Sivakuruburu were given as grants for lightening the perpetual lamp in these temples. In 1923 Madras endowment Board had taken the temple under its control. Vijilapuram Venugopalaswamy Temple was constructed during 1265 A.D.-1299 A.D. by Varamala Naidu.The Zamindar had donated 32,000 rupees worth of villages of Beggilipalli, Gudla kadirepalli and Pakampalli for the maintenance of perpetual lamp and conduct of Annual & routine rituals.  The hereditary Customary rights were acquired by the descendants of Zamindars on 05.05.1937. Sri Prasanna Venkateswara Swamy Temple at Thimmampeta was built during 1783 – 1823. 

Beyond these architectural achievements, Kangundi saw the birth of the 'Nataka Samajam,' a theatrical society designed to entertain the women of the area.This society brought folk ballads, Gobbi songs, Kolatam dance, and leather puppetry into the cultural fabric of the region. Vijayendra Bhattacharya', the disciple of Siddhendra yogi, a Kuchipudi Bhagavatar of considerable renown, left a significant mark on regional performing arts. This influence ultimately gave rise to the unique 'Kangundi Plays' tradition, transforming the village of Kothaindlu into a heritage hub for traditional theater. In more recent times, numerous artists from this tradition have gained recognition both nationally and internationally.

The inscription at the Venugopalaswamy temple in Vijilapuram details Varamala Naidu's administrative accomplishments. Raja Venkatapatai Naidu, the final Zamindar of Kangundi, who reigned from 1910 to 1947, oversaw the renovation of the Siva temple, a remnant of the Chola Period. He also undertook the restoration of the Venugopalaswami Temple at Vijilapuram in 1923. The 1930s saw the introduction of a post office, a police station, and public transportation. Roads such as Russel Road, Meloni Road, Bayyai’s Road, and Seetaramayya Street were constructed in Vijilapuram. He established "Vetagiri Kotturu" as a tribal settlement. 

The Kodanda Rama Alayam in Ramakuppam was built by Jodidars.\
In 1890, Tulasiram das, a follower of Bhakta Kabirdas, spread the message of Bhakti and brought a sense of humanism to the community. Annadanam, or food offerings, along with bhajanas and Harikathas, were frequently observed. The Chaudeswari Temple, the oldest temple from the Chola period in Ramakuppam, features the Sapta Matrikas carved on a monument. The Lakshmi Narasimha temple in Ramakuppam is second only to the Kadiri Narasimha Swamy temple. During the Vijayanagara period, the Venugopalaswami Temple was constructed at Basinikuppam, atop the the 2000-foot-high Krishnamma Konda.

**Temple Architecture**

The monuments' survey demonstrates the extent to which the region's historical edifices drew upon the architectural styles of prominent dynasties, including the Cholas, Pallavas, Hoyasalas, Vijayanagara rulers, and the Muslim rulers of Mysore. The Virupaksha and Krishnaswami/Venugopalaswamy temples at Kangundi, along with the Siva and Venugopalaswamy temples at Vijilapuram, are representative of the Chola period. Within the Siva temple at Vijilapuram, the Garbhagriha features a dome-shaped structure, and both the linga and Nandi are crafted from black basalt. The architectural preferences of the Hindu south were particularly evident in the ground plans, pillars, plaster-coated masonry, and arabesques. Chola temples can be categorised in two groups– Early Temples and Later Temples; early temples are influenced with Pallava architecture while later have Chalukya influence. The Krishnaswami Temple at Kangundi is surrounded by high boundary modest in size . At the top there is oval shaped shikhara known as Vattara Shikara in Dravidian architectural terms on which kalash like part is placed..** The** Prakara (Enclosure Walls) – High protective walls built of granite with a walkway for devotional rounds (pradakshina). the architectural style of the temple reflects the Sandhara Ekayatana style, a classic layout associated with early chola temple transitions where a single , independent sanctum sactorium(Garbhagriha) dedicated to the primary deity Krishnaswami and the entire structure being elevated upon a massive, high stone platform known as ‘Jagati’serves to physically and symbolically lifting the deity above the earthly plane. Absence of antarala with pillars is conspicuous. 

Makara Torana, Dasavatara  and other symbolic motifs are reflected on the main entrance of prakara in Kirshnaswami temple at Kangundi. This depiction symbolises kala, or Time, which destroys and destroys and devours all human beings. In the course of time, the makara was conceived as a large leviathan animal that could accommodate even an elephant between its jaws. Water Cosmology thus relates to the belief in the aquatic origin of all life, which must have, naturally, been conceived by hydraulic civilizations that sprang along rivers like the Nile, Euphrates, Indus and the Ganges, where seasonal rains and the constant flow of rivers produced abundance, through agriculture. The later chola ones from Vijilapuram were huge and large with Vimanas or Gopuras dominating the landscape The Kalikamba temple at the foot hills of the Mallappa konda in Kangundi fort was once the centre of mother goddess for sacrificial rituals by tribal community of Irula which was later converted into Kalikamba temple by local Silpi castemen while constructing the Fort. The sri chakra over the roof within the sanctum sanctorium speaks the conversion of cult centre into a sanskritised sakta centre prohibiting the sacrificial traditions.  
### **Hero Stones**
Across Kangundi–Kuppam, hero stones (vīragallu or natukkals) commemorate men who died defending cattle, land, and honor in a region marked by raids and conflict. Evolving from Iron Age burial monuments like cists, dolmens, and stone circles (patukkai), these stones shifted from marking burials to publicly celebrating heroic death, especially during cattle raids and warfare. Inscriptions from the Vijayanagara period in Krishnagiri, Mulbagal, and Gudiyatham show that local chiefs governed villages and tanks while serving larger dynasties, forming the basis for the Kangundi zamindari within the Nayaka system. Villages such as Veeranagapuram, Kalannur, Biruddanapalli, Sajjalapalli, Gudupalli, Girreppavanka, Bellakogila, Kangundi, and Ramasamudra still bear these stones, reflecting pastoral communities’ struggles to protect herds. A notable shrine in Avulanattham depicts a hero fighting a tiger, alongside a bull figure, and is still worshipped annually on Sankranti in Mallanuru, three kilometres south, with offerings to the ancestral hero Patappa, who once defended people and cattle from tigers. These stones link Iron Age, Sangam-era, and medieval commemorative traditions, preserving personal sacrifice within the Dravidian cultural and political landscape of South India.

The *Veeragal* at *Girrepppavanka* in Kangundi is such that amidst the women a man was riding over a horse which denotes that a chieftain was getting ready for a war. The heroic deeds of these warriors are glorified by his kin group, who perform puja to the hero stone during the festive occasions. Their rituals, are symbolic, capable of stimulating active involvement in war, there by idealizing the   family lineages of the warrior chiefs. 

**Inscriptions of Kangundi and Gundla sagaram**

Epigraphical evidence from the Upper Palar belt indicates that temples were systematically endowed with land and revenue rights during this phase. Inscriptions from Gudiyatham, Tirupattur, and Krishnagiri, dated between Śaka 1120 and 1180 (c. 1198–1258 CE), record *devadāna* grants of wet and dry lands to Shaiva temples for the maintenance of lamps, daily worship, and festivals.² An inscription dated February 22(Saturday), in A D 1776, found in the premises of Kangundi Panchayat office, on the right side of the boulder supporting Hanuman statue, registers that Gutti, Konkana armed chief and Anganamali Chieftain 'Basava Sankara' titled Metapalem Javvaji Kambi Naidi Pamminaidu's grandson and son of Venkatapati Naidu Sri Varamurthi Naidu, constructed the temple for Hanumantharaya and consecrated the God's idol in it. This was done as the dharma in the memory of his mother Mangamma garu and his father Venkatapati Naidu.[^4]

The stone inscription found at Gundlasagaram village in Kuppam Mandal of present-day Chittoor District, is engraved on a large rock lying close to the Virabhadraswami Temple, a space that clearly functioned as a focal point of village life.[^5] The record dates back to Saka 1482 corresponding to A.D 1560 and begins with an auspicious invocation and speaks of a Dharma charter bestowed by Mahamandaleswara Modini Misaraganda Maharayana Bhujapratapa Devaru Narasanayaru through his officer (karyakarta) and the commander (danayaka) Veeramarasayya for the Amaranayaka authority, the village of Gundlasagara, situated in Gonuguru seema is granted to Gonuguru veerabhadraswamy for the daily naivedya of Amritapadi. This late medieval period, between the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries CE, was the time when the Vijayanagara state and its successors shaped the political and cultural landscape of the Rayalaseema–Kuppam region. The inscription reveals that this royal decree was enacted for the village's benefit. Subsequently, the villagers united to delineate boundaries and confirm their claims to land, water, and revenue. This text describes a communal land grant from the Vijayanagara period, emphasizing its moral and religious significance. It highlights the inscription's role in ensuring the agreement's durability and the interconnectedness of kingship, community decisions, temple economies, and dharmic values in the rural administration of the era (circa 1400–1600 CE).

**Contemporary Cultural Heritage and Significance**

The Zamindars of Kangundi's Pannagasayana Bhavan, located in Kuppam, is a symbol of power that reflects the spirit of Hindu architecture. Folk architecture is another way that the sense of place is inscribed on the landscape, both visible and invisible, as can be seen in the town of Kuppam. The patterns of traditional building found directly through field documentation provide an index to regional personality. 

The region's festival traditions represent some of the most elaborate and culturally significant celebrations in South India, with the Yamaganipalle Mahabharata Mahothsavam being the height of cultural achievement.The entire Mahabharata epic is presented in chronological order during this remarkable 20-day celebration, which features elaborate enactments of key episodes from Udanka Charitra through Dharmaraja's coronation ceremony. The festival's organizational complexity includes specialized roles for various communities, intensive educational components with daily lectures, dramatic combat scenes at a designated "Kurukshetra" battlefield, and spectacular fire-walking ceremonies that draw 25,000 devotees from a radius of 40 to 50 miles away. These celebrations exhibit remarkable cultural continuity, with some maintaining two to three centuries of continuous observance while incorporating both traditional elements and modern innovations like radio broadcasting and modern transportation systems.

**Locating Kangundi -Kuppam in Baramahal Zone**

The Baramahal region occupied a crucial transitional zone in South India during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. Lying between the Mysore plateau and the Tamil plains, it formed the northern extremity of the Salem district and consisted of twelve Mahals or parganas, including Krishnagiri, as noted by Francis Buchanan and later colonial administrators[^6]. 

Before Kangundi became a part of Andhra Pradesh, it was a part of Baramahal in the then Madras Presidency. Baramahal is a name loosely applied in English histories to the north-eastern corner of Salem District, Madras, but no longer in use. It apparently included the taluks of Tirupattur, Krishnagiri, Dharmapuri and Uttangarai in Salem, and the Kangundi. The political narrative of the Jagadeva Raya lineage situates the Baramahal region as a strategically significant frontier zone during the late Vijayanagara and immediate post-Vijayanagara period.[^7] The fort network described in the tradition preserved by Le Fanu—including Jagadeva-gadai, Raya-kota, Anchetti-Durgam, Ratnagiri, Budi-Durgam, Nilagiri-Durgam, Chendrayagiri-Durgam, and other hill forts—constituted the military spine of Jagadeva Raya authority.[^8] This tract, granted around 1578 A.D. as a reward for military service in the defence of Penukonda, was sparsely populated, heavily forested, and militarily volatile. The deliberate encouragement of settlement through liberal land grants to followers, migrant communities, and indigenous populations indicates a systematic effort to transform a frontier landscape into a productive and defensible territorial unit. Within this framework, Kangundi should be understood as part of the Baramahal region, which was shaped by Fort-based administration, palaiyam authority, and agricultural expansion, rather than as a distinct village.[^9] The region acquired exceptional political and administrative importance after the Treaty of Seringapatam signed on 17 March 1792, by which Tippu Sultan ceded extensive territories to the English East India Company. Within weeks of this treaty, the Ceded Districts of Salem and Baramahal were entrusted to Captain Alexander Read, [^10]whose selection reflected the Company’s recognition that the administration of a newly annexed and ecologically complex territory required innovation rather than routine bureaucratic methods [^11] Kangundi became the permanent settlement Village/Samsthanam since 1793 where British East India Company  established fixed land revenue payments from the hereditary land owners i.e zamindars. Thomas Munroe and Captain Read made Baramahal region as an experimental zone for the introduction of Ryotwari settlement 

The headquarters of the Zamindars was Bhattuvaripalle/ Vijilapuram and the Diwan office along with the treasury was located at  Kuppam, which was also the residence of the Zamindari. But the Tahsil got its name from the village of Kangundi, which was formerly the chief town in this part of the country.The population rose from 54,052 in 1891 to 64,446 in 1901, the increase during the decade (19%) being the highest in any portion of the district. The increase was largely due to the existence of several gold mines, a continuation of those in the adjoining Kolar gold fields in the par which borders in Karnataka State i.e the erstwhile Mysore state. The number of villages was 268. Previously there were 360 villages under this principality. Since it is a triangular region in Dravidian land people speak Telugu, Tamil, and Kannada. In the post-colonial period, when the Zamindar’s rule came to an end, the Zamindari’s prominence was known only in the name of Kuppam. 	 

Baramahal was a basin bounded by hill ranges and secondary Ghats, receiving both southwest and northeast monsoons, which supported dry crops, wet rice, and garden produce. Its semi-arid uplands, pastoral tracts, and irrigated valleys made uniform revenue assessment difficult and unsuitable for the Bengal-style zamindari, prompting the British to experiment with village-based ryot settlements. Kangundi, in the Baramahal–Upper Palar transitional zone near Salem, North Arcot, and Chittoor, had rocky terrain, scrub vegetation, and grazing lands, fitting the Tamil mullai–palai continuum of pastoralism, seasonal cultivation, and cattle protection. These conditions favored small-holder cultivation over large estates, and Kangundi became a key site for British adaptation of land administration, illustrating the interaction of landscape, economy, and governance in South India’s transition from pre-colonial to colonial rule.
### **Social Structure and Settlement**
The Kangundi Zamindari encompassed a complex social fabric, including warrior groups like the Vannikula Kshatri**yas**, farming communities such as the Balija Naidus, hunting groups like the Boyas, and pastoral Kurubas. As agriculture expanded, dense forests gradually gave way to the Bayalusima plains, with new settlements often created through land grants to temples and Zamindars. Jodidars oversaw irrigation tanks essential for farming, and skilled workers such as the Vaddera**s** reshaped the landscape. Villages frequently developed around regional deities, notably Kota Basaveeswara**,** while temple rituals reinforced existing social hierarchies.

### **Administrative Evolution**
Kangundi, part of Baramahal in the Madras Presidency, included taluks such as Tirupattur,** Krishnagiri, Dharmapuri, Uttangarai, and Kangundi**.** The Zamindari had 268 villages, with dual headquarters: the Zamindar in Bhattuvaripalli (Vijilapuram)** and the Diwan’s office in Kuppam**.** Jodidars managed tax collection for pairs of villages. The Zamindari survived nearly 900 years** under** 27 generations of ruler**s**, adapting to Pallava, Chola, Hoysala, Vijayanagara, Mughal, and British authority. 

### **Land and Taxation**
Land ownership evolved from tribal communal holdings to feudal Zamindari estates and finally individual holdings. Under the Ryotwari system**,** each field was assessed individually, securing occupancy rights and providing flexibility in Kangundi’s dry tracts. In **1792**, wet lands were taxed** 2–14 rupees per acre**,** dry lands 0.5–3.5 rupees per acre**,** and sugarcane at 72 pagodas per candy. Zamindari demands under the 1802 experiment led to land abandonment, but Ryotwari principles later stabilized revenue collection and agricultural productivity.

**Inam and Manyam Land Grants**

Land grants called manyams, rewarded village officials and skilled workers, by linking caste and occupation to land. Examples include Thotimanyam for Mala caste water managers, Gurrala manyam for horse grazers, and Mangali manyam for barbers. Brahmins received Brahmadeyam lands for ritual and accounting services. Balijas cultivated lands called Gurikaallu**,** giving half the produce to Zamindars, while some farmers paid 4–7 rupees for cultivation. This system reinforced hierarchical land relations and village governance.

**Forests, Agriculture, and Animal Husbandry**

The Kangundi Zamindari managed 55,000 acres of forest, supplying 7,200 tons of fuel wood to the Madras Railways in 1880–81 and supporting sandalwood oil production. The Zamindari was the second largest supplier of fuel wood for Railways of Madras Presidency and also to Kolar gold mines. This has long term effect on kangundi-Kuppamr region resulting in Low Rainfall and drought conditions. This resulted in famine and plague haunting the region. 

` 	 `Raja Venkatapathi Naidu (1918–1950)** promoted modern agriculture and animal husbandry. The Hosur cattle farm focused on dual-purpose bulls and milk production. Fodder experiments included Kolukattai and Rhodes grass**,** the latter yielding 15,000 lb from 10 acres. Agricultural fairs (1926–28) introduced iron ploughs, paddy transplantation, water location by hand boring, and improved sugarcane furnaces **(**Sindhi Vahini**).** Dairy farming expanded with Delhi-bred buffaloes**.**

**Mining, Infrastructure, and Cultural Continuity**

Kangundi formed part of South India’s auriferous belt, with mines at Mallapakondah**,** Bagalur**,** Beriki**,** and  Sholagerry producing gold using sophisticated indigenous techniques. Roads, postal services, policing, and public transport integrated the region into colonial administration. Despite colonial pressures, plague outbreaks, and economic changes, the region maintained traditions. Festivals attract participants from Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu, linking local culture with commerce. Kangundi–Kuppam today exemplifies resilience, preserving tribal, feudal, colonial, and modern influences while maintaining long-standing social, religious, and agrarian structures.

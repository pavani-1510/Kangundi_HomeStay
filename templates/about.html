            <p class="section-text">
                Early South Indian villages are understood as foundational social units from which later urban forms emerged. As J. W. Hewitt observes, "the primitive village must have been the parent of the earliest form of the later city, which is invariably built round a centre, the site of the original market place and temple". This structural observation is directly relevant to villages such as Kangundi, where temples, markets, and agrarian spaces formed the nucleus of settlement life. The origins of these villages are traced to forest-dwelling communities who gradually transitioned to settled agriculture.

            <p class="section-text">
                The historic village of Kangundi located in Chittoor district of Andhra Pradesh, was constitutive of Baramahal during the late medieval period and witnessed the successive layers of economic stages ranging from Tribal formations to feudal mode of production and then shared tastes and dispositions thus making it as cultural and social habitus. The then Zamindari is located in the eastern part of Kuppam and south-west corner of Krishnagiri district, lying between 12°35' and 12°56' N and 78°14' and 78°35' E, with an area of 347 sq.miles. It is located in the south west of Chittoor at a distance of 54 miles.

            <p class="section-text">
                No Paleolithic or Neolithic tools have been found in the plains of the region, though later Stone Age implements are abundant and display finer workmanship than those of the Deccan. Neolithic tools occur mainly in the hill ranges of the Shevaroys, Kalrayans, Kolli-malais, Vattala-malais, Melagiris, and the Guttirayan. Cairns and Pandava "pits" or "shrines," locally known as <em>Pandavagullu</em>, are widely distributed along the Morappur–Harur road, near Kundani, Gummalapuram, Bapalanattam near Palamaneru, and in villages around Kuppam, where Kuruba communities venerate them as ancestral monuments.
            </p>
            <p class="section-text">
                Archaeological explorations reveal a dense concentration of prehistoric sites dominated by megalithic burials associated with iron-using cultures that reached South India around 700 BCE. The scale and organization of these monuments indicate advanced social and political systems, generally linked with Dravidian-speaking communities that were culturally dominant in the later first millennium BCE. In Chittoor district, megaliths remain embedded in village life, seen in cairns near Mallakunta, the dolmen known as <em>Pandavula Banda</em> at Marrimakulapalle, painted rock shelters near Venkateswara Kotalam and Biradanapalle, demonstrating the continuity of prehistoric heritage in living traditions.
            </p>
            <p class="section-text">
                The tribal formations in Kangundi are evident with the presence of indigenous tribes of Irula and Yanadi and the prehistoric rock paintings in the Kangundi Hill. The prehistoric rock painting in the Kangundi hill stands as a living example for the antiquity of the region. The region of Kuppam in Chittoor District along with Hosur in Tamilnadu is a trilingual and tricultural Dravidian land. Once popular as Kangundi Kuppam named after the first habitation Kangundi by the local zamindars.

            </div>
            <p class="section-text">
                Kangundi Kuppam, a pre-capitalist samsthanam, or principality, thrived for centuries, embodying a deep bond between the ruler and the ruled. This ancient estate in South India, as genealogical records reveal, was governed by approximately twenty-seven generations. Over the course of nearly nine centuries, the Kangundi Zamindari was under the control of roughly twenty-six rulers, each pledging loyalty to the political forces that periodically dominated the entire South.
            </p>
            <p class="section-text">
                The recorded history of the Kangundi-Kuppam area kicks off in 1066 AD. It all started with Kambinaidu, a direct descendant of Mallinaidu, who hailed from the Pyapili chiefdom in Kurnool district. Kambinaidu, the third son of Mallinaidu, a minor chieftain in Pyapili, left his home and made his way to Maharajgarh. He established a settlement there, which he named 'Anganamala', on the higher ground. At the base of this upland, he constructed a fortified settlement called 'Gonuguru'.
            </p>
            <p class="section-text">
                A space for religious articulation was created by constructing a temple for <em>Veta/Betarayaswamy</em>. Legitimisation of chiefdom was made by representing their hunting activity in the form of the deity being engaged in hunting. He then extended his friendship to Kangadu, the Irula Tribal leader and his wife Kangi who controlled the present Kangundi village. Through them, Kambi Naidu came to know the secret routes from the Kangundi Hill. The strategic location of Kangundi attracted his attention for strengthening of his power in the region. According to official records, after defeating the tribal couple, the Zamindars made it mandatory to perform puja to their burials on Mallappa Konda (the Kangundi hill), demonstrating a complex relationship between conquest and spiritual acknowledgment.
            </p>
            <p class="section-text">
                He fortified the hill and constructed a palace at its base, while building temples dedicated to Malleswara and Basaveswara on the hilltop, creating both military and religious infrastructure. His territorial expansion extended across multiple regions including Tummisi, Diguvapalem, Chinna Kangundi, Betamangala, Tayalur, Budikota, Melpatti, and Javadipalem through defeating respective feudal lords, establishing a feudal chiefdom that would evolve into one of South India's most enduring zamindari systems. The name 'Kangundi Durgam' was a tribute to the vanquished tribal leader Kangadu.

                <h2>Temple Architecture and Cultural Development</h2>
            </div>
            <p class="section-text">
                The culmination of Kangundi's development occurred during Raja Chinnaveerappa Naidu's reign (1185-1231 AD). He commissioned the impressive Kangundi Krishnaswami and Virupaksheswara temples, funded by grants from the villages of Kennavasanapalli and Sivakuruburu. Chinnaveerappa Naidu also made his mark on agriculture, implementing tank irrigation systems and constructing the substantial "Tata Veerappanayudu's Cheruvu" reservoir.
            </p>
            <p class="section-text">
                The monuments' survey demonstrates the extent to which the region's historical edifices drew upon the architectural styles of prominent dynasties, including the Cholas, Pallavas, Hoyasalas, Vijayanagara rulers, and the Muslim rulers of Mysore. The Virupaksha and Krishnaswami/Venugopalaswamy temples at Kangundi, along with the Siva and Venugopalaswamy temples at Vijilapuram, are representative of the Chola period. The architectural style reflects the Sandhara Ekayatana style, a classic layout associated with early Chola temple transitions.
            </p>
            <p class="section-text">
                Beyond these architectural achievements, Kangundi saw the birth of the 'Nataka Samajam,' a theatrical society designed to entertain the region. This society brought folk ballads, Gobbi songs, Kolatam dance, and leather puppetry into the cultural fabric of the region. This influence ultimately gave rise to the unique 'Kangundi Plays' tradition, transforming the village of Kothaindlu into a heritage hub for traditional theater.

            </div>
            <p class="section-text">
                Across Kangundi–Kuppam, hero stones (<em>vīragallu</em> or <em>natukkals</em>) commemorate men who died defending cattle, land, and honor in a region marked by raids and conflict. Evolving from Iron Age burial monuments like cists, dolmens, and stone circles, these stones shifted from marking burials to publicly celebrating heroic death, especially during cattle raids and warfare.
            </p>
            <p class="section-text">
                Villages such as Veeranagapuram, Kalannur, Biruddanapalli, Sajjalapalli, Gudupalli, Girreppavanka, Bellakogila, Kangundi, and Ramasamudra still bear these stones, reflecting pastoral communities' struggles to protect herds. A notable shrine in Avulanattham depicts a hero fighting a tiger, alongside a bull figure, and is still worshipped annually on Sankranti. These stones link Iron Age, Sangam-era, and medieval commemorative traditions, preserving personal sacrifice within the Dravidian cultural and political landscape of South India.

                <h2>Kangundi in Baramahal Zone</h2>
            </div>
            <p class="section-text">
                Before Kangundi became a part of Andhra Pradesh, it was a part of Baramahal in the then Madras Presidency. The Baramahal region occupied a crucial transitional zone in South India during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. Lying between the Mysore plateau and the Tamil plains, it formed the northern extremity of the Salem district.
            </p>
            <p class="section-text">
                The region acquired exceptional political and administrative importance after the Treaty of Seringapatam signed on 17 March 1792, by which Tippu Sultan ceded extensive territories to the English East India Company. Kangundi became the permanent settlement Village/Samsthanam since 1793 where British East India Company established fixed land revenue payments from the hereditary land owners i.e zamindars. Thomas Munroe and Captain Read made Baramahal region as an experimental zone for the introduction of Ryotwari settlement.
            </p>
            <p class="section-text">
                The headquarters of the Zamindars was Bhattuvaripalle/Vijilapuram and the Diwan office along with the treasury was located at Kuppam, which was also the residence of the Zamindari. But the Tahsil got its name from the village of Kangundi, which was formerly the chief town in this part of the country. Previously there were 360 villages under this principality. Since it is a triangular region in Dravidian land people speak Telugu, Tamil, and Kannada.

            </div>
            <p class="section-text">
                The Kangundi Zamindari encompassed a complex social fabric, including warrior groups like the Vannikula Kshatriyas, farming communities such as the Balija Naidus, hunting groups like the Boyas, and pastoral Kurubas. As agriculture expanded, dense forests gradually gave way to the Bayalusima plains, with new settlements often created through land grants to temples and Zamindars. Jodidars oversaw irrigation tanks essential for farming, and skilled workers such as the Vadderas reshaped the landscape. Villages frequently developed around regional deities, notably Kota Basaveeswara, while temple rituals reinforced existing social hierarchies.

                The Zamindars of Kangundi's Pannagasayana Bhavan, located in Kuppam, is a symbol of power that reflects the spirit of Hindu architecture. Folk architecture is another way that the sense of place is inscribed on the landscape. The region's festival traditions represent some of the most elaborate and culturally significant celebrations in South India, with the Yamaganipalle Mahabharata Mahothsavam being the height of cultural achievement.
            </p>
            <p class="section-text">
                The entire Mahabharata epic is presented in chronological order during this remarkable 20-day celebration, which features elaborate enactments of key episodes from Udanka Charitra through Dharmaraja's coronation ceremony. The festival's organizational complexity includes specialized roles for various communities, intensive educational components with daily lectures, dramatic combat scenes at a designated "Kurukshetra" battlefield, and spectacular fire-walking ceremonies that draw 25,000 devotees from a radius of 40 to 50 miles away.

                Raja Venkatapathi Naidu (1918–1950) promoted modern agriculture and animal husbandry. The Hosur cattle farm focused on dual-purpose bulls and milk production. Agricultural fairs (1926–28) introduced iron ploughs, paddy transplantation, water location by hand boring, and improved sugarcane furnaces. The 1930s saw the introduction of a post office, a police station, and public transportation.
            </p>
            <p class="section-text">
                Kangundi formed part of South India's auriferous belt, with mines at Mallapakondah, Bagalur, Beriki, and Sholagerry producing gold using sophisticated indigenous techniques. Roads, postal services, policing, and public transport integrated the region into colonial administration. Despite colonial pressures, plague outbreaks, and economic changes, the region maintained traditions. Festivals attract participants from Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu, linking local culture with commerce.
            </p>
            <p class="section-text">
                Kangundi–Kuppam today exemplifies resilience, preserving tribal, feudal, colonial, and modern influences while maintaining long-standing social, religious, and agrarian structures. The region stands as a testament to the enduring legacy of its ancient past, continuing to evolve while honoring its rich historical heritage.
